# chatgpt-texas-roadhouse-reservation
I used only code from ChatGPT to make this.

How to run:

Navigate to the directory

run `source env/bin/activate` for Linux/Mackbook or run `.\env\Scripts\activate` on a windows

run `python -m http.server 8000`

run `python backend.py`

Then navigate to localhost:8000 and input all the information needed for your reservation and leave the app running on your comupter until you get a text and email from texas roadhouse. 

***There is no validation please put in a valid email address and a 10-digit phone number! If these are wrong you won't be able to make your reservation!***

If you show up 15 minutes before or after your reservation time you should be able to text HERE back to them and be seated quickly.
